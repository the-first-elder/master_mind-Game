## Introduction

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game for two players. It is a game of logic, deduction, and strategy where one player creates a secret code, and the other player tries to guess the code within a limited number of attempts.

## Components

- **Decoding Board**: A board with rows of holes for placing pegs.
- **Colored Pegs**: Pegs in various colors used to create and guess codes.
- **Key Pegs**: Smaller pegs used to give feedback, typically in two colors (black and white).

## Setup

1. **Select Roles**: Decide who will be the codemaker and who will be the codebreaker.
2. **Create the Secret Code**: The codemaker selects a sequence of four colored pegs and places them in the code area behind a screen to hide the code from the codebreaker. The sequence can contain duplicates and any combination of colors.

## Rules

1. The codemaker creates a hidden code using four colored pegs.
2. The codebreaker has a set number of attempts (usually 10 or 12) to guess the code.
3. After each guess, the codemaker provides feedback using key pegs:
   - Black key peg: Correct color in the correct position.
   - White key peg: Correct color in the incorrect position.
4. No key peg indicates incorrect color.
5. The feedback pegs do not indicate which pegs in the guess are correct, only how many.

## Gameplay

1. **First Guess**: The codebreaker places a row of four colored pegs on the decoding board.
2. **Feedback**: The codemaker places the appropriate number of black and white key pegs next to the guess to provide feedback.
3. **Next Guesses**: The codebreaker makes successive guesses, using the feedback from previous guesses to inform their strategy.
4. **Repeat**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the codebreaker correctly guesses the code or exhausts the allowed number of attempts.

## Feedback

- **Black Key Peg**: Indicates one peg is the correct color and in the correct position.
- **White Key Peg**: Indicates one peg is the correct color but in the wrong position.
- **No Key Peg**: Indicates one peg is an incorrect color.

The key pegs do not specify which particular pegs in the guess are correct.

## Winning the Game

- **Codebreaker Wins**: If the codebreaker guesses the exact sequence of the codemaker's code within the allowed number of attempts.
- **Codemaker Wins**: If the codebreaker fails to guess the code within the allowed number of attempts.

## Strategy Tips

- **Start with Diversity**: Begin with a guess that includes a variety of colors to gather maximum information.
- **Use Process of Elimination**: Use the feedback to eliminate impossible combinations and narrow down the possibilities.
- **Pay Attention to Patterns**: Look for patterns in the feedback to identify which colors are correct and in which positions.
- **Balance Between Colors and Positions**: Gradually focus on getting both the colors and their positions correct as you refine your guesses.

## Variants

- **Different Lengths**: Vary the length of the code (e.g., 3 or 5 pegs) to change the difficulty level.
- **Additional Colors**: Increase the number of available colors to make the game more challenging.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Play multiple rounds and alternate roles to determine an overall winner based on cumulative performance.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ambiguous Feedback**: Ensure the codemaker provides clear and consistent feedback with the correct number of key pegs.
- **Misinterpretation**: Double-check each guess and feedback to avoid misunderstandings.

## FAQs

1. **Can colors be repeated in the code?**
   - Yes, the codemaker can use any combination of colors, including duplicates.
2. **How many attempts does the codebreaker have?**

   - Typically, the codebreaker has 10 or 12 attempts, but this can be adjusted for difficulty.

3. **What happens if I run out of pegs?**

   - You can reuse pegs from previous guesses once feedback has been given.

4. **Can we play with more than two players?**
   - Yes, you can play in teams or take turns being the codemaker and codebreaker.

Enjoy playing Mastermind and sharpen your code-breaking skills!
